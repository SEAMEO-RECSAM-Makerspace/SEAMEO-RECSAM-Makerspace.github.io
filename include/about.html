        <p style="padding: 0 10% 0 20%; text-align: justify;">
            A makerspace is a physical space that provides access to equipment and guidance in a flexible format that responds 
            to the interests and skill levels of users collaborating on self-directed projects. These spaces allow users or “makers” 
            to explore their passions in a creative and inclusive way while perfectly aligning with the mission and vision of SEAMEO 
            RECSAM on equity of access, experiential development and lifelong learning.
            <br><br>
            The makerspace provides an opportunity to add on value with a learning environment that empowers teaching and learning. 
            This makerspace showed that science educators, administrators and librarians collaborate to create makerspace with which 
            students design projects, products and engage in activities that teachers skills in applying technology tools. </p>

            <p> Here we can have a brief description about the SEAMEO RECSAM Makerspace and what makes the SEAMEO RECSAM Makerspace special.
                If that is not enough content, then this part can also include a brief description about SEAMEO RECSAM.  <br><br>
                e.g. SEAMEO RECSAM, the Southeast Asian Ministers of Education Organization Regional Centre for Science and Mathematics, is dedicated to 
                promoting and improving science and mathematics education in Southeast Asia. Established in 1967, we work collaboratively with member 
                countries to enhance the quality of STEM education through training, research, and development.</p>

            <p> The general purpose of our project is to add on value with a learning environment that empowers teaching and learning. 
                In line with this general objective, our project aims to support the academic, social and professional development in 
                Malaysia through the STEM model (technical training based on technology such as coding, simple machines, engineering 
                applications, robotics, 3D design, and printing, etc.).  <br><br>
                All the education Specialists at SEAMEO RECSAM will conduct workshops/activities every month for different related themes 
                at the SEAMEO RECSAM Makerspace. </p>

            <ul>
                <li>To improve teachers' skills in applying technological tools. </li>
                <li>To emphasise STEM education through STEM workshops. </li>
                <li>To include teachers and students in active training through coding, simple machines, 
                    engineering applications, robotics, 3D Design and Printing workshops.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                To create simulations with web 2.0 tools that embody engineering design processes. Convert these simulations into real life skills 
                with technical legos.

        <div class="w3-col m6">
            <p style="padding: 5% 10% 5% 10%; text-align: justify;"> <strong>RATIONALE</strong>
            Our project is based on 'learning by experiencing and doing'. In fact, with the 
            innovative method, which will be named 'learning by designing, constructing and 
            producing' in terms of the project, students will be able to print a robot arm with 
            a 3D printing machine, they will be able to move the arm by coding and make all 
            movements in the embedded system. 
            <br>
            In this project, teachers and students will first gain a new generation of knowledge 
            by learning through experiencing and doing, their innovative aspects will be revealed, 
            and they will contribute to the country's work force in the long term. In fact, the 
            success of this project will trigger many similar studies in the region. With this 
            project, teachers and students will be ensured to present their innovative ideas that 
            can be applied in all fields of life and their entrepreneurial souls will be enabled. 
            <br>
            In STEM education, there is a system approach in which teachers and students are 
            directly in the centre in schools, where laboratories, smart boards, 3D prints, 
            Arduino, robotic sets, web 2.0 tools are used and technology is directly included 
            in education conditions. In this way, teachers and students can fulfil project-based 
            and problem-based learning which is compatible with the understanding of constructivism 
            with an interdisciplinary approach and obtain more qualified academic achievements.
            <br><br>
            <strong>CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK</strong>                                
            The ability to assist pupils in understanding their surroundings is one of the most 
            crucial aspects of education. In order to encourage learning by doing and experience 
            learning, the proposed makerspace will adapt the 5E Inquiry-Based Learning conceptual 
            framework. Additionally, by utilising an inquiry-focused teaching strategy, 
            students/participants can apply their knowledge and establish links between scientific 
            ideas and their daily lives. With its focus on usable design, creativity, and innovation, 
            the maker movement is considered to embrace constructivist  learning, which emphasises 
            the active role of learners in developing their own understanding.
